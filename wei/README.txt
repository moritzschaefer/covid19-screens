Wei et al. don't provide raw reads of their screens. They only provide read count tables for their sgRNAs. 

Instead of filtering out duplicate sgRNAs (5017), I merged their targets, as I did for our own Vero-data. Further, based on the sgRNA-sequences, I identified the ENSEMBL IDs for ~1000 genes, which had generic LOC-gene-ids and replaced them.
