# Covid19 screening

This repository holds the scripts and source code for the analysis of various SARS-CoV2 pooled CRISPR screens as described in the paper ....

The folder brunello1, brunello2, calabrese and vero correspond to the screens performed by us. The other folders correspond to previously published screens.

Code for comparing the different datasets is found in sars_cov2_analysis.py. The visualizations generated by the scripts are found in the file comparison.pdf.

Further documentation can be found in the README-files of each subdirectory.
